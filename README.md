# Code Sourced
The [random.cpp](https://github.com/Lucky38i/1st-Year-Comp-SCI-Project/blob/master/Space%20Shooter%20SFML/random.cpp) was entirely sourced from [here](https://youtu.be/owr_OBkE5Z4?t=43s)

```C++

#include "random.h"

}

int generateRandom0(int max)
{
	int randomNumber = rand();
	float random = (randomNumber % max);
	int myRandom = random;

This class base was used for AI movement and sprite selection and a few more things I can't thing of, however the functions and lines of code that made use of this class were of my own
